   Notes:
   1) REFIN determines the DAC full-scale output (~2 to 5V OK)
   2) Setting the DAC register to all 0s minimizes power consumption
   3) VDD needs to be 5V
   4) Continuous current at any terminal not to exceed 20mA
   5) The TLC5615 is 10 bit but values between 0 and 2047 are accepted to
      maintain compatibility with other DACs.  Voltage varies linearly.
